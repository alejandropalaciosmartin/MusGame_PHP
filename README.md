# Mus Game Simulation in PHP

## Overview
This PHP project simulates the classic Spanish card game "Mus" with a simplified version featuring two players, each holding a hand of four cards. The simulation evaluates different possible moves, including "Grandes" (highest cards), "Chicas" (lowest cards), "Pares" (pairs), and "Juego" (game), determining the winner for each move.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need a web server with PHP support, such as XAMPP or WAMP. If you don't have a web server set up, you can try the online demo available at [DEMO](https://musphp.000webhostapp.com/).

## Features
- Simulated Mus card game with two players.
- Evaluates and displays the winner for "Grandes," "Chicas," "Pares," and "Juego" moves.

Feel free to explore the code, learn about Mus game dynamics, and use it as a foundation for more complex game implementations.

Enjoy your Mus game simulation experience!
